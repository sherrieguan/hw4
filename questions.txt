1. What is an object?
- A collection of name value pairs
- Objects have data inside of it
  - For example: an x, an y, a diameter
  - How you get data for almost EVERYTHING in java
- Helps you group multiple variables
- Syntax is like:
  var circle= {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    diameter: 50
  };


2. How do you access a property of an object?
- Refer back to the var object with a dot syntax
  - For example:
  ellipse(circle.x);


Arrays:
- An array is a list of values in separated by a comma
- similar to an object
i.e.
var num = 5;
var nums = [5, 3];


3. What is the index of the first item in an array?
- index is 0
- Always need to start counting the elements from 0 in code


4. What syntax can you use to get the third item in an array?
- Refer to the array name and index
- i.e. nums[2]
- nums would refer to the whole array
- i.e. text(words[index], 12, 200); ... index = index + 1;

5. How do you use a variable and a loop to get every item in an array?
- Use a for loop that uses the var i in the function from your array
- You can use an array to have many elements and apply the same action to all elements
- i.e. for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    ellipse(i * 100 + 100, 200, nums[i], nums[i]);
  }
